# Ozark Oak and Steel

This is the Ozark Oak and Steel site.  It was a site used for promoting and selling 
furniture when I made furniture.  All graphic content copyright Colin Shaw.

The idea was to abstract some of the features having to do with categorized product
presentation into some middleware and cut a support gem out of it.  Reason being that
there were no especially desirable middlewares of this nature at the time that I was
aware of.  Never happened.
